        The system initially recognizes the existence of cars in the provided data and then classifies the precise model of each detected car. 
        By leveraging deep neural networks, inspired by the human brain, we achieve unprecedented accuracy in car detection and model recognition.

        This project includes a user-friendly web interface that allows users to upload images and receive predictions about car models.
