        The automotive industry is witnessing a remarkable transformation driven by advancements in artificial intelligence and deep learning. 
        This project explores the exciting world of YOLOv8, a state-of-the-art deep learning framework for object detection and recognition.

        The system initially recognizes the existence of cars in the provided data and then classifies the precise model of each detected car. 
        By leveraging deep neural networks, inspired by the human brain, we achieve unprecedented accuracy in car detection and model recognition.

        This project includes a user-friendly web interface that allows users to upload images and receive predictions about car models. 
        The project not only highlights advancements in AI and deep learning but also sets the stage for future innovations in the automotive industry.
